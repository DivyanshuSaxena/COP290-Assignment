# COP290-Assignment

This repository holds the documentation and code for the assignment in the Course COP290 (Design Practices). The aim is to develop a software package for Engineering Drawing.


The package is supposed to have the following functionalities:
   1. We should be able to interactively input or read from a file either i) an isometric drawing and a 3D object model or ii) projections on to any cross section.
   2. Given the 3D model description we should be able to generate projections on to any cross section or cutting plane.
   3. Given two or more projections we should be able to interactively recover the 3D description and produce an isometric drawing from any view direction.
